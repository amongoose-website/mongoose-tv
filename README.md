This project began with a stack of physical DVDs. Tony, the founder, editor and publisher of A. Mongoose, would send out physical copies of the books, charts and DVDs. However this put a limit on the distribution of these resources and put a heavy work load on Tony to continue distributing the resources for free. 

Tony and I have worked together, building a free service to distribute DVDs, books, charts as well as frequent blog posts. To better understand the content visit [Amongoose.com](https://amongoose.com/) where the books, charts and blog posts are hosted. The videos component of the website ([Mongoose Tv](https://tv.amongoose.com)) provides over 700 documentaries.

Tony and I have created these services without a budget and therefore a lot of the components of the website have been created by ourselves rather than using existing propriety software such as a CDN for the documentaries. The videos are all self-hosted, which is OK for now as there isn't heaps of traffic. We are hoping in the future to extend to CDN hosting, using the current set up as a backup.
